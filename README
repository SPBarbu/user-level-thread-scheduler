Valgrind indicates memory leaks on my IEXEC and CEXEC pthread_creates,
but this is probably an issue with Valgrind because the threads are successfully joined by pthread_join in sut_shutdown.

The connection in IEXEC is TCP so it is assumed that the library user will either sleep before calling sut_read or call sut_read multiple times to receive all their data.
